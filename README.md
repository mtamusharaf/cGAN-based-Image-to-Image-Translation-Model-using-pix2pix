# Pix2Pix-Based cGAN for Image-to-Image Translation

This repository implements an image-to-image translation system using a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN), based on the Pix2Pix model. The system can handle tasks like photo editing, style transfer, and colorization, delivering high-quality and realistic image translations.

**Features**

* Implements a cGAN-based architecture with:
  * U-Net Generator for producing realistic image outputs.
  * PatchGAN Discriminator for evaluating localized realism.
* Conditional adversarial training for paired image datasets.
* Supports tasks such as:
  * Style transfer.
  * Image colorization.
  * Domain adaptation (e.g., sketches to photos).
* Trains models with a combination of adversarial loss and L1 loss for high-quality outputs.

**Requirements**

To set up and run this project, you'll need the following:

Dependencies:
* Python 3.8+
* TensorFlow 2.8+
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Pillow
* GPU support recommended (CUDA-enabled GPU)

Install the dependencies using:
**pip install -r requirements.txt**

**Hardware Requirements**

* A CUDA-enabled GPU with at least 8 GB VRAM is recommended for training.
* Sufficient disk space for storing datasets and model checkpoints.

**Results**

During training, the model learns to translate input images into target images effectively. After sufficient training, the Pix2Pix model can generate highly realistic outputs conditioned on the input images.

**Example Applications**

1. Image Colorization: Convert grayscale images to color.
2. Sketch-to-Photo Translation: Generate realistic photos from sketches.
3. Style Transfer: Apply artistic styles to images.

**Model Architecture**

1. Generator (U-Net)
The generator uses an encoder-decoder U-Net architecture:
* Downsampling: Extracts features using convolutional layers.
* Upsampling: Reconstructs the image while combining encoder features via skip connections.

2. Discriminator (PatchGAN)
The discriminator evaluates image pairs (input + output) at the patch level, focusing on localized image realism.

**Loss Functions**
1. Adversarial Loss: Encourages the generator to produce realistic outputs.
2. L1 Loss: Minimizes pixel-wise differences between the generated and target images.
